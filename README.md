# BREAST-CANCER-ANALYSIS
An analysis of women who had infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer.

# OVERVIEW
Breast cancer, is the second most common cancer in women after skin cancer and the most common cancer globally, accounting for 12.5% of all new annual cancer cases worldwide. Out of curiosity, I carried out this analysis to educate myself more and create awareness. 

# DATASET
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and it contains 4024 patients with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer that is, a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands of the breast. It also contains 16 fields which make up the columns of the dataset.

# DATA ASSESSMENT AND CLEANING
To make sense of a data, it is essential to understand the dataset and access the various fields. To carry out this action, I uploaded the dataset into Microsoft Excel. By doing this, I realized there was a lot I didn’t know so that led me to do a lot of research on the dataset. 
Afterwards, I uploaded the dataset to power query where I checked for null and empty values and also created a conditional column for age groups. Fortunately, there wasn’t much altering to do with the dataset so I moved to the analysis.

# ANALYSIS
The dataset was imported into Power BI where it was analyzed and visualized.

# RESULTS
* The dataset contains 4024 patients, about 15% of them are deceased and the rest are living with the tumor. 
the analysis revealed that there are more white women than black and other races and more married women than single and single women than divorced.

* Age disparities: studies show that women above 40 are more at risk of breast cancer and this analysis also confirmed that. Women between the ages of 40-59 makes up about 63% of the total patients while women between 30-39 are about 6% of the total patients.

* Hormonal factors: it has been proved that a woman’s risk of breast cancer is related to the estrogen and progesterone made by her ovaries and being exposed for a long time and/or to high levels of these hormones has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. This analysis proved that the majority of the patients had positive estrogen and progesterone levels and about 82% of the patients tested positive for both hormones.

* Cancer stages: This describes the size of the tumor and how far it has spread from where it originated. In about 97.7% of the patients, the cancer is at the REGIONAL stage which means that it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or organs, and in about 3.3%, the cancer is at the DISTANT stage and has spread to distant parts of the body which is more fatal.

* Cancer grades: This describes the appearance of the cancerous cells. Numbers are assigned to represent the differentiation of the cancer cells. More patients have moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated carcinoma than well-differentiated and undifferentiated carcinoma.

# VISUALIZATION
I utilized different charts on Power BI to display my analysis. Afterwards, I compiled all the charts into a well-detailed dashboard.
